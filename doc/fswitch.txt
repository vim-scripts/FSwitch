2. About~

FSwitch is designed to allow you to switch between companion files of source
code (e.g. "cpp" files and their corresponding "h" files).  The source for
this came from a home-grown script that was influenced later by the
"Alternate" (a.vim) script.

The original intention was to modify the existing a.vim script to do what the
home-grown version could do (choose to open the other file in an existing
window) but it was a rather complex script and modification looked difficult
so the choice was made to simply move the home-grown script forward a couple
of notches and produce a new plugin.  This doc file is twice the length of the
actual code at this point :)

==============================================================================
							*fswitch-features*
3. Features~

FSwitch has the following features:

  - Switches between a file and its companion file
  - Ability to create a new file using a preferential location
  - Simple configuration using buffer-local variables
  - Umm... other stuff?

==============================================================================
							*fswitch-setup*
4. Setup~

Most of the behaviour of FSwitch is customized via buffer-local variables.
You set up the variables with auto commands:
>
  au! BufEnter *.cpp let b:fswitchdst = 'hpp,h' | let b:fswitchlocs = '../inc'
<
That |:autocmd| will set the 'fswitchdst' and 'fswitchlocs' variables when the
|BufEnter| event takes place on a file whose name matches {*.cpp} (e.g. when
you enter the buffer containing the {MyFile.cpp} file).

The variables above state that the alternate file to {MyFile.cpp} are
{MyFile.hpp} and {MyFile.h} preferred in that order, and located in the {inc}
directory at the same level as the current directory.

That should get you there but there's more capability here if you want.  To
get that move on to |fswitch-configure|.

==============================================================================
							*fswitch-configure*
5. Configuration~


							*'fswitchdst'*
'fswitchdst'	string	(default depends on file in current buffer)
		local to buffer

	The 'fswitchdst' variable denotes the file extension that is the
	target extension of the current file's companion file.  For example:
>
		:let b:fswitchdst = 'cpp,cxx,C'
<
	The above specifies that the current buffer's file has a companion
	filename which can be found by replacing the current extension with
	{cpp}, {cxx} or {C}.  The extensions will be tried in this order and
	the first match wins.

	'fswitchdst' is taken relative to directories that are found in the
	'fswitchlocs' variable.

							*'fswitchlocs'*
'fswitchlocs'	string	(default depends on filen in current buffer)
		local to buffer

	The 'fswitchlocs' variable contains a set of directives that indicate
	directory names that should be formulated when trying to find the
	alternate file.  For example:
>
		" Create the destination path by substituting any
		" 'include' string from the pathname with 'src'
		:let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:/include/src/'

                " First try adding the relative path '../src' to the path
		" in which the file in the buffer exists and if that fails
		" then try using 'source' instead
		:let b:fswitchlocs = 'rel:../src,source'

		" Same as above but leaving off the optional 'rel:'
		:let b:fswitchlocs = '../src,../source'
<
	The following types of directives are understood:

	reg:~
		A regular expression.  The regular expression takes the form:
>
			{delim}{pat}{delim}{globsub}{delim}
<
		Where:
		
		{delim}   is something that doesn't appear in {pat} or
			  {globsub} used to delimit the {pat} and {globsub}

		{pat}	  is a standard pattern to search on

		{globsub} is a substitution string that will be run through
       		          the |glob()| function.

	rel:~
		A relative path.  The {rel:} is actually optional.  If you
		leave this off, then FSwitch will assume that the string is
		denoting a relative path.
	
	abs:~
		An absolute path.  I have no idea why you'd ever want to do
		this, but it's there if you want it.

							*'fswitchdisablegloc'*
'fsdisablegloc'
		string	(default off)
		local to buffer
	
	Disables the appending of the default global locations to the local
	buffer definition.  Normally when processing alternate file locations
	FSwitch will append some default values to the list of locations.  If
	you define this variable then this will not happen.

	The default locations are currently set to "./" or ".\" depending on
	what slash your configuration evaluates to.

							*'fswitchnonewfiles'*
'fsnonewfiles'
		string	(default off)
		local to buffer and global
	
	This variable is both global and local.  If you want to disable the
	creation of the alternate file when it doesn't already exist you can
	choose to do this on a per-extension basis or globally.  Set the
	global one to shut it off all the time and use the buffer version to
	shut it off locally.

							*'fsneednomatch'*
'fsneednomatch'
		string	(default off)
		local to buffer and global
	
	Normally when doing a regular expression alteration of the path (see
	{reg:} in 'fswitchdst' the pattern you're going to substitute the
	value with must actually match in the string.  When it doesn't matter
	whether or not that the match actually takes place, you can set this
	value.

	If you do set this then the failure to match actually results in
	nothing happening at all.  So if the right filename exists in the same
	directory as the one you're switching from then that's the one that
	will be switched to.

	Example:
>

		If the b:fswitchlocs is set to

		   reg:/src/include/,include

                and

		  # This is the file we're editing
		  ~/code/program/myfile.c

		  # These choices exist for the header file
		  ~/code/program/myfile.h
		  ~/code/program/include/myfile.h
<
	Then the first substitution will result in the first header file being
	chosen, not the second.

==============================================================================
							*fswitch-altcreate*
6. "Creating" the Alternate File~

If the file being switched to does not exist, and 'fsnonewfiles' has not been
set, then it will be created as a new, unwritten buffer.  If there are
multiple possibilities here, FSwitch prefers the first possible match.  For
example if the current buffer has a filename called {/code/src/a/b/MyFile.cpp}
and has the following set:
>
		let b:fswitchdst = 'h,hpp'
		let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:/src/include/,../include,../inc'
<
then the created filename will be {/code/include/a/b/MyFile.cpp}.

As stated, this file hasn't actually been written to yet so you could easily
delete the buffer and there's no harm done but you also may not be able to
write the buffer very easily if the directory hierarchy doesn't yet exist.  In
this case, it's quite helpful to define a mapping for easily creating the
directory for you:
>
		nmap <Leader>md :!mkdir -p %:p:h<cr>
<
Then it's pretty easy to create the directory before writing the file.


==============================================================================
							*fswitch-mappings*
7. Useful Mappings~

I didn't bother putting mappings into the script directly as this might have
caused conflicts and I don't know how to avoid those.  I use the following
mappings myself:

 - Switch to the file and load it into the current window >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>of :FSHere<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into the window on the right >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>ol :FSRight<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into a new window split on the right >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>oL :FSSplitRight<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into the window on the left >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>oh :FSLeft<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into a new window split on the left >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>oH :FSSplitLeft<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into the window above >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>ok :FSAbove<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into a new window split above >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>oK :FSSplitAbove<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into the window below >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>oj :FSBelow<cr>
<
 - Switch to the file and load it into a new window split below >
	nmap <silent> <Leader>oJ :FSSplitBelow<cr>
<
==============================================================================
							*fswitch-function*
8. The FSwitch Function~

The main work is done by the FSwitch() function.  The reason it's documented
here is because you can use it to do something more interesting if you wish.
As it stands now, you get the "Split Above and Switch" functionality by
calling FSwitch() like this:
>
    FSwitch('%', 'split \| wincmd k')
<
There's probably not much to stop anyone from doing something more interesting
in the second argument.  If this string is non-empty then it will be run
through an |:execute| call.

==============================================================================
							*fswitch-defaults*
9. The Default Settings~

By default FSwitch handles {c} and {cpp} files, favouring {cpp}.

For *.h files:
>
    let b:fswitchdst  = 'cpp,c'
    let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:/include/src/,reg:/include.*/src/,../src'
<
For *.c
>
    let b:fswitchdst  = 'h'
    let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:/src/include/,reg:|src|include/**|,../include'
<

For *.cpp
>
    let b:fswitchdst  = 'h'
    let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:/src/include/,reg:|src|include/**|,../include'
<

==============================================================================
							*fswitch-examples*
10. Examples~

							*fswitch-example1*
Let's say you have a C++ codebase and it has the following properties (this
level of insanity is a bit high but versions that are only slightly saner
exist in real life):

	- Source files with {.cpp}, {.cc} and {.C} extensions
	- Header files with {.h} extensions
	- Source files and header files in the same directory
	- Source files in the {src} directory and include files in the
	  {include} directory
	- Source files in the {src} directory and include files in the
	  {include/name/space} directory (i.e. subdirectories denoted by the
	  namespace).
	- Source files in {src/name/space} and header files in
	  {include/name/space} (i.e. subdirectories denoted by the namespace).

As a final part to this, the "new" way of doing things in this source tree is
to put header files in a directory noted by namespace and to do the same with
source files and to name source files with a {cpp} extension.

In order to switch between files organized like this, you could specify the
following:
>
 augroup mycppfiles
   au!
   au BufEnter *.h let b:fswitchdst  = 'cpp,cc,C'
   au BufEnter *.h let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:/include/src/,reg:/include.*/src/'
 augroup END
<
Here the setting of b:fswitchdst to {cpp,cc,C} handles the different C++
extensions, and prefers to use {cpp} and will create new files with that
extension.

The fswitchlocs setting allows for the following:

	reg:/include/src/~

		Take the pathname to the file in the current buffer and
		substitute "src" for "include".  This handles the following
		possibilities:

		- Files are in {include} and {src} respectively
		- Files are in {include/name/space} and {src/name/space}
		  respectively

	reg:/include.*/src/~

		Take the pathname to the file in the current buffer and
		substitute "src" for "include.*".  This handles the following
		possibility:

		- Files are in {include/name/space} and {src} respectively
	
	./~
		This one's a hiddden option.  The default location is the
		current directory already so we don't explicitly have to state
		this, but it is the last possibility:

		- Files are in the same directory

							*fswitch-example2*
Here we'll just show a quick example of making use of the globbing aspect of
the system.  Let's say you're working on a {cpp} file and you want to find the
matching header file, and you have your destination and locations set to the
following:
>
	let b:fswitchdst = 'h'
	let b:fswitchlocs = 'reg:|src|include/**|'
>
then if you have the a file {src/MyFile.cpp} then this will find the file
{include/name/space/MyFile.h}.
